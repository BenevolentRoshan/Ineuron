1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans: 1. True 2. False


2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
ANS: 1. and 2. or 3. not
1.	and: True if both operands are True
2.	or: True if at least one of the operands is  True.
3.	not: True if both operands is False.


3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans: Truth table for and, or, not is following
•	and Truth table
X Values	Operator	Y values	Return
True	and	True	True
True	and	False	False
False	and	True	False
False	and	False	False

•	or Truth Table
X Values	Operator	Y values	Return
True	or	True	True
True	or	False	True
False	or	True	True
False	or	False	False

•	not Truth rable
Operator	Y values	Return
not	True	False
not	False	True


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
Ans: 
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                                        #False
not (5 > 4)                                                 #False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                                         #True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))                                   #False                        
(True and True) and (True == False)                         #False
(not False) or (not True)                                   #True


5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans: Six comparison operator are following
1.	Greater than                      >
2.	Less than                         <
3.	Greater than equal to             >=
4.	Less than equal to                <=
5.	Equal to                          ==
6.	Not equal to                      !=


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans: Equal to operator is use compare two values or operands while assignment is use to assign value(right side ) to the variable(left side).
We use  ‘=’  operator to assignment and ‘==’ operator to comparison.
e.g.  x=6    # value 6 is assigned on variable x
        5==4  # comparing whether 5 is equal to 4. 
   
   
   
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
ans:  Three block are following 
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
            print('eggs')                            # block 1
            if spam > 5:
                         print('bacon')             # block 2
            else:
                        print('ham')                 # block 3
           print('spam')
print('spam')



8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans: 
       Spam =int( input(“User input : ”))
       If spam==1:
            print(“Hello”) 
      elif spam==2:
            print(“Howdy”)
      else:
            print(“Greetings!”)



9. If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ans: CTRL + C


10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans:  break statement just terminate the loop and jump to next statement or loop while continue statement just skip the current iteration and executes next iteration of the loop.
Break keyword is used for break statement and
Continue keyword is used for continue statement.



11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans: no difference. All three will produce the same result.



12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans:
Using for loop:
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i, end=" ")

Using while loop :
i=1
while i<=10:
    print(i, end=" ")
    i+=1
    
    
    
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans: 
from spam import*
bacon()
