1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
* 
'hello'
-87.8
- 
/ 
+	
6 
Ans:  Values: ‘hello’, -87.8,6
               Expression:  -, /, +


2. What is the difference between string and variable?
Ans: String is a type of data data/value that get stored.
         While Varaible stores values and data.


3. Describe three different data types.
Ans: 
     1.	Numbers: int, float, complex e.g int = 10,13,65; float = 10.2,3.45, 0.05; complex = 10+6j, 7j  etc
     2.	Sequence: String, List, Tuple
        String: sequence of character: 'Roshan', 'iNeuron'
        List: Stores collection of data. E.g. L=[1,4,4,'Howdy', 7+4j]
        Tuple: It’s like List except values can’t be change. e.g. T=(1,4,4,'Howdy',7+4j)
     3.	Non- sequential: Set, Dictionary.
        Set: Stores Collection of distinct data. e.g. S={1,4,'Howdy',7+4j}
        Dictionary: Stores data in key-pair format. e.g. D= {a:1,b:4,c:'Howdy'}

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Ans: Operators and operand. Expression represents the value.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Ans: Expression represents the value while Statement is a programming instruction that can be execute.

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Ans:  bacon = 23

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
Ans: Both will have same result : ‘spamspamspam’

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans: a variable name must always start with letter(a-z,A-Z) or underscore ( _ ). 
Since eggs is starting with letter it is a valid variable name while 100 is starting with number thus it is not a valid variable name.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
Ans: int(), float(), str().

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
Ans: sting and integer can’t be concatenate together. Only after converting a integer into string they can be concatenated.
Example : 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
